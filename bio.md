Daniil Skiba

A proactive and multifaceted individual, I possess a strong aptitude for web and game development. My commitment to personal growth is evident in my regular judo training, where I cultivate discipline and physical prowess. Additionally, I am currently developing my dexterity and observational skills through the fascinating art of magic, focusing on card and coin manipulation.

Based in MÃ¡laga, Andalusia, Spain, I am also an avid participant in cybersports, with a particular interest in virtual reality titles such as Gorilla Tag and VRFS (Virtual Reality Football Soccer). My athletic interests extend to traditional sports, including outdoor football, which I engage in for both recreation and structured training. My primary sports passions include judo, basketball, and swimming.
